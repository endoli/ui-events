A cross-platform input event abstraction modeled after W3C UI Events specifications.

Provides common vocabulary types for working with pointer events (mouse, touch, pen) and
keyboard events in a platform-agnostic way. The crate aims to closely follow W3C standards
while remaining practical for native application development.

Includes support for:

- Pointer events (down/move/up, pressure, tilt, etc.)
- Keyboard events (key codes, modifiers, location)

For integration with [`winit`], use the companion [`ui-events-winit`] adapter crate.

## Features

- `std` (enabled by default): Use the Rust standard library.
- `kurbo`: Add convenience methods for easily converting dpi positions to kurbo `Point`s.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of UI Events has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.82** and later.

Future versions of UI Events might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of UI Events' dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
