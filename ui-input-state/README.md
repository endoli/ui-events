Frame-oriented input state built on `ui-events`.

This crate provides simple state containers to make input handling easier in
immediate-mode or frame-based UIs. Instead of reacting to each event
individually, you feed pointer and keyboard events into the state, query the
current and per-frame information during your update, and then call
[`InputState::clear_frame`] at the end of the frame.

## What it provides:

- [`PrimaryPointerState`]: current pointer state, coalesced and predicted motion,
  per-frame button transitions, and helpers for motion in physical/logical units.
- [`KeyboardState`]: current modifiers, keys down, and per-frame key transitions.
- [`InputState`]: a convenience container bundling both states and a per-frame clear.

## Typical lifecycle per frame:

1. Receive backend events and convert them to `ui-events` types.
2. Update `PrimaryPointerState` and `KeyboardState` with the events.
3. Read state during your UI update (e.g. check just pressed, motion, etc.).
4. Call [`InputState::clear_frame`] before the next frame.

## Example (sketch):

```rust
use ui_input_state::{InputState, PrimaryPointerState, KeyboardState};
use ui_events::pointer::PointerEvent;
use ui_events::keyboard::KeyboardEvent;

let mut input = InputState::default();

// 1-2) In your event loop, feed events into state
fn on_pointer_event(input: &mut InputState, e: PointerEvent) {
    input.primary_pointer.process_pointer_event(e);
}
fn on_keyboard_event(input: &mut InputState, e: KeyboardEvent) {
    input.keyboard.process_keyboard_event(e);
}

// 3) During your update pass, read state
fn update(input: &InputState) {
    if input.primary_pointer.is_primary_just_pressed() {
        // Begin a drag, for example
    }
    if input.keyboard.key_str_just_pressed("z") && input.keyboard.modifiers.ctrl() {
        // Ctrl+Z
    }
}

// 4) At the end of the frame, clear per-frame transitions
fn end_frame(input: &mut InputState) { input.clear_frame(); }
```

## Coordinates and units

Pointer positions are stored in physical pixels with a Y-down axis, as in
`ui-events`. Use [`PrimaryPointerState::current_logical_position`] and
[`PrimaryPointerState::logical_motion`] to work in logical units.

## Features

- `std` (enabled by default): Use the Rust standard library.
- `libm`: Enable `ui-events/libm` transitively for `no_std` environments.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of UI Input State has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.82** and later.

Future versions of UI Input State might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of UI Input State's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
